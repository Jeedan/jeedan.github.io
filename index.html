                <h4>Ludum Dare 32 An Unconventional Weapon</h4>
                <p>This game was developed for the ludum dare competition, a 48-72hr long game jam. All the player and enemy models were made by me, the environment are free assets that were provided by other jam participants. It is a small game about killing rats and spiders with a broom and vacuum cleaner.</p>

                <h4>Star Fox Unity Clone/Homage</h4>
                <p>I love the old Star Fox 64 game, so I thought I should see if I can code my own version. I learned a lot from this project, especially how hard it is to create atmosphere and position enemies well so the player can shoot them. This is 1 of the projects I want to return to later and add more levels and other features.</p>

                <h4>Pokemon Battle Simulator</h4>
                <p>A small battle simulator, I started this project to do some turn based battle system. It is a very different style of programming games then I am used to, however very fun. In this small simulator you fight the opponent with your attack and when he dies the simulator is over.</p>

                <h4>Complexity</h4>
                <p>Complexity a university project, we were 2 artists and 2 coders making a small game. I was tasked with the player and enemy controllers. The game consists of you solving a mini box puzzle, as well as defeating goblins and collecting coins.</p>

                <h4>Don't Fall!</h4>

                <p>A small doodle jump clone, I made this to get accustomed to Unity features as well as get to know the code. This along side the Space Rail shooter are the games I will always come back to creating in different ways just to spice up my knowledge and see how far I have come in creating the same games using different and superior methods.</p>
